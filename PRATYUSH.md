## 🚫 What I don’t wanna DO:
- ❌ Waiting to turn 18  
- ❌ Waiting for IIT, VC, or permission  
- ❌ Waiting for someone to say “you’re allowed to build that”  
- ❌ Waiting for school to catch up
- ❌ Waiting for Investments from Goverment or University

## 🔥 What I *Am* Doing:
- Shipping projects even funded startups fear to try  
- Teaching myself more than most curriculums offer  
- Building tools, products & systems for the future  
- Writing my legacy with code

## 🗣️ My Vibe:

> “They said: *‘build real things when you’re older.’*
